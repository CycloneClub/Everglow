# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-09-12)

**Core value:** Deliver a complete, publishable Kelp Curtain layer whose designed regions, gameplay loop, creatures, terrain, items, bosses, encounters, and rewards work together as a coherent Terraria experience.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Remaining Items & Unfinished-Art Materials

## Current Position

Phase: 2 — Remaining Items & Unfinished-Art Materials
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-09-12 — Phase 01 complete, transitioned to Phase 2

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 13%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: n/a
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1–8 | 0 | TBD | n/a |
| 01 | 5 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:** No execution data yet.
**Per-Plan Metrics:**

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 01 P01 | 21min | 3 tasks | 9 files |

| Phase 01 P05 | ~14min | 3 tasks | 8 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- The three Feishu second-layer documents are authoritative; every item is compared through XML full fetch and receives green/exact, yellow/partial-conflicting, or unchecked/blocked status.
- Execution order is mandatory: items, ordinary monsters, terrain/generation, bosses and special encounters, then publishable integration.
- Within each content category, complete design artwork/textures precede incomplete artwork/textures; biology-design drops are item work and are not deferred to monster phases.
- Phase 1 owns source/inventory reconciliation, including Biology's three region labels and Terrain's additional Green Tundra and Town of Decaying Wood labels; Phase 8 owns final source-status synchronization.
- Explicit hardmode-deferred entries and undefined future designs remain outside this milestone.
- [Phase 01]: Evidence snapshots are committed as well-formed <fragment> XML; the offline parser is header-anchored and rowspan-aware, and validator exit 3 accepts an empty texture checkbox id only when a blocker is recorded.
- [Phase 01]: Tranche is assigned from the resolved repo class content family (or parser category when class-less); the terrain-sourced row takes an empty tranche.
- [Phase 01]: advances is type-based (ITEM-01/ITEM-02) with procurement overrides to ITEM-03/ITEM-04 and ITEM-07 on every entry.
- [Phase 01]: A shared-placeholder-texture class (RadialCarapace -> White_Mod) is recorded artwork-incomplete/yellow despite the Feishu checkbox; Green Tundra stays unresolved with a blocker.
- [Phase 01]: Design 价格 maps to Item.value (buyPrice/raw value); oversized sellPrice(...) usages are completed-art deviations corrected in 01-03.
- [Phase 01]: 01-03 tranche A halted at Task 2 by its >8 bound (18 class-less completed-art entries); PHASE SPLIT RECOMMENDED with a per-category breakdown.
- [Phase 01]: Replanned 01-03 completed the D-12 effect/recipe/set-bonus remainder: 7 recipes exact, 34 effects matched to wired projectiles/buffs, 4 effect blockers recorded.
- [Phase 01]: All 43 class-less entries routed to Phase 2 (phase=2); 18 completed-art entries also deferred with a reason; RadialCarapace and VineRepairWand stay phase 1 per D-11.
- [Phase 01]: ThornTurtleShell run-speed corrected to the design -10%; check-tranche-A.ps1 gates the 38 completed-art tranche-A entries.
- [Phase 01]: Tranche-B design rows were header-anchored; the recipe embedded after '=' in the 效果 cell is a recipe (DevilHeart armor 18/20/32/24 bars at an Anvil).
- [Phase 01]: The four missing DevilHeart armor recipes and the Ruin/material rarity+value deviations were fixed (D-12); the Witherbark minion pattern, set-bonus display text, and Photophore misimplementation were recorded as blockers outside plan 04's file scope.
- [Phase 01]: Phase 1 localization is deferred by user directive (2026-09-12, 'record it; do not consider localization, just complete the code portion'); the in-game exporter was not run, no key was fabricated, and no HJSON was hand-edited. The 13 missing-key entries are recorded as status=deferred deviations (45/58 covered; advisory -AllowMissing baseline).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Feishu source reconciliation must classify all five terrain labels and inventory every item/drop before implementation acceptance.
- Missing approved artwork must remain a visible blocker; no placeholder art may be introduced.
- Yggdrasil generation, rendering, subworld, persistence, and multiplayer behavior require live tModLoader verification beyond unit-test coverage.
- 01-03 (replanned) resolved the halt: the 18 class-less completed-art tranche-A entries and the 25 art-incomplete class-less entries are routed to Phase 2 (phase=2); the tranche gate `check-tranche-A.ps1` is authored (38 covered). Four tranche-A weapons carry 效果 blockers (MossySpell, CyatheaArrow, GreenSungloStaff, EvilHalbertBarnacle) whose design behavior lives in projectiles outside the item-class modify set.
- RadialCarapace and VineRepairWand remain Phase 1 tracked blockers (code-complete, artwork-missing per D-11); their design deviations are queued to Phase 2 (D-12).
- Phase 1 localization is deferred by user directive: 13 completed-art items lack both-culture display keys (EvilHalbertBarnacle, ArcI, RedAlgaeMagicStaff, RedAlgaeMagicSpellBook, RedAlgaeMagicWhip, CrimsonMoonSap, EmptyWaterStaff, JadeLakeRedAlgae_Item, Photophore, GreenSungloStaff, ActivatedDogStaff, RedAlgaeMinionGyroscope, RedAlgaeMinionStaff). Run the in-game OutputLocalizationHjsonItem exporter (or resolve in Phase 2). Recorded in 01-DEVIATIONS.md and 01-INVENTORY.json.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At | Milestone |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Hardmode | Explicitly hardmode-deferred source entries, including Withered Seed and Witherbark Guard | Deferred | 2026-09-11 | Kelp Curtain second layer |
| Future design | Undefined future Yggdrasil layers and later second-layer additions | Deferred | 2026-09-11 | Kelp Curtain second layer |
